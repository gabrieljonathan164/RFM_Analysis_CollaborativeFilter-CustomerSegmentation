# SMART RETAILER - A CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
## USING RFM ANALYSIS, MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS & ITEM BASED COLLABORATIVE FILTER 

"Smart Retailers," a new quality information product, is an online information product for a local grocery store. The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model that uses market basket analysis to identify correlations between items in customers' shopping carts. Market basket analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique that can be used to identify correlations between frequently purchased items online and important relationships between products, which can help smart retailers increase online sales and generate revenue. It can also assist in identifying products that customers frequently purchase together in a single transaction or across multiple transactions.

Started by using the RFM analysis, which considers the recentness, frequency, and dollar amount of purchases, and can be used in combination with both datasets to provide even deeper insights into consumer behavior and assist retailers in identifying profitable customer segments. By using this data, personalized offers can be made, customer retention can be improved, and customer lifetime value can rise. In general, these datasets are essential for a smart retailer because they provide the data required to comprehend consumer behavior and improve business plans. To perform RFM analysis, we use the customer's purchase history data from our data set to create three different measures: RFM-R (recency), RFM-F (frequency), and RFM-M (monetary). RFM-R will be calculated by determining the number of days since the last purchase using the max and min functions from the order date. RFM-F will be calculated using the distinct count of invoice IDs for each customer ID.

Further the datasets were enhanced by assessing their F-scores, R-scores, and M-scores. RFM-M is the monetary value attribute using the sum of the spent amount per customer ID. After creating these measures, I improved these elements by assessing their RFM Scores, which will be labeled as R-score, F-score, and M-score, and then I created quartiles. Values falling in the first 25 percentile will be assigned an R-score of 1, while values in the top 75 percentile will be assigned a score of 1 for RFM-F and RFM-M. I then computed a combined RFM score and used it to segment the data with a series of if-else statements in the calculation field to categorize customers as Gold, Silver, or Bronze.
